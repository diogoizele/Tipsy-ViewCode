# Tipsy 🍷

## Disclaimer

This project intentionally diverges from the traditional Storyboard approach to enhance the learning experience and gain a deeper insight into iOS development using **View Code**.

## Overview

Welcome to Tipsy, a Tip Calculator App. Unlike the conventional Interface Builder with Storyboard method, Tipsy is an exploration into programmatic UI using `ViewCode`. 🚀💡

## Learning Objectives

### 1. **Programmatic UI Proficiency**

- **Storyboard Transition:** In this project, I consciously shifted away from Storyboards, opting for a programmatic approach using `ViewCode`. This showcases proficiency in crafting user interfaces without the constraints of Interface Builder. 💻🎨

### 2. **Beyond Challenge Guidelines**

- **Creative Implementation:** Instead of strictly adhering to challenge guidelines, I chose a more challenging path by discarding the provided Storyboard files. This decision allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of constructing an app from the ground up programmatically. 👊🏗️

### 3. **Introduction to MVVM Architecture**

- **Architectural Understanding:** Tipsy delves into the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This architectural choice signifies a deeper understanding of code organization, separation of concerns, and scalability. 🏛️📐

## First Swift Project for the Portfolio

This project holds significance as my initial Swift view-code project for the portfolio. It represents for me a great step toward mastering the foundations of iOS development. 🛠️📝
